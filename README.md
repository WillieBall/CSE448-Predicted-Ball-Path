An App for mobile devices that predicts the path of a bowling ball. The app is made with React and connects to a bluetooth gyroscope that is inserted into the thumb hole of a bowling ball. The gyroscope comes with api endpoints that give you information when the ball is thrown, such as speed, rotation, and distance traveled. Users create an account that is stored on a MySql database. This allows users to store information about the balls they use that help determine the projected path of the ball using the ball information and gyroscope data. Fields that the user may insert for each ball is the type of ball, weight, color, and brand. Other fields the user may input are the type and amount of oil used on the lane and on the ball. The app includes a simulation that shows a lane and where the ball is predicted to go based on previous shots and the other information provided. Users can decide how many of there previous shots to use in the simulation.
